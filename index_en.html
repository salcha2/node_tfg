						  <p> Art-Risk is a computerized tool for preventive conservation of heritage in urban centres based on artificial intelligence models.
                    For its development, a new method has been developed to analyse the vulnerability and risk of unique buildings. All this is carried out by a multidisciplinary team.
                    Thanks to this, it is possible to evaluate the decision making process in land use planning, urban planning and treatment of Historical Heritage, with which for the first time a transversal vision can be applied that includes the heritage, urban planning, architectural and cultural value, the analysis of the environmental surroundings and the socio-demographic situation of the work. 
                    All this allows for decision-making based on scientific criteria and thus minimizes the risk of loss of heritage elements.
						  This tool allows the approximate reproduction of human reasoning and the existing relationships between vulnerability factors, risk factors and historical parameters of the monument through the theory of diffuse sets.
